# Polynomial-Solver-Language
## Introduction
Polynomial Solver Language (PSL) is a brand new programming language design to
solve the most common mathematical operations on all types of polynomials. The main
motivation is based under the impression that writing polynomials in any current language is a
little hard, because the user needs to implements data structure and it will not be able to use
any type of variable. Therefore using PSL the user will be able to express any polynomial
expression with any variable he desires and perform any of the mathematical functions, with the
main goal of focusing on the math part and keep practicing of solving polynomials. It would be
like solving exercises on paper but using a programming language.
